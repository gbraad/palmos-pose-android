Currently, the automake/configure code has not been successfuly
converted to create a proper Makefile for 'libpose.so', the Android
native library. We're working on it - though contributions would be
welcome!

If you download the Android NDK, and follow the directions in the
"STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN.html" file, you can set up a toolchain in /tmp.
The included Makefile will build libpose.so from there.
